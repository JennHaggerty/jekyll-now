I"‡<p>As I was setting up my best friendâ€™s website <a href="http://getthisoutofmycloset.shop">GetThisOutOfMyCloset.shop</a>, she has amassed a large collection of art supplies, artworks, and skin care products that are taking over her closet space so weâ€™re making an online shop to clear it out, she mentioned me setting up a blog to detail the technical work Iâ€™ve been doing. For a long time Iâ€™ve been reluctant to begin a blog finding them to be time consuming, per my attempts to start a blog for my hobby with photography and painting, yet I now equate them to documenting client projects, which Iâ€™m a fan of doing so here it goes.</p>
